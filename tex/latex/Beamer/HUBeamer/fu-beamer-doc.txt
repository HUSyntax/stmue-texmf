HU Beamer is based on Roland Sch√§fer's styles for FU presentations.

It has been adapted to xelatex. Do not use dvips and ps2pdf.

*************
*** RULES ***
*************


- ALWAYS USE DVIPS as backend driver when rendering, i.e. always use the
render chain LATEX -> DVIPS -> PS2PDF (and not PDFLATEX)!


- Don't include graphicx manually.
- Don't include ifthen manually
- Don't use graphics instead of graphicx.
- Don't change inner/outer/color/font... themes manually.
- Don't use deprecated options like [blackandwhite]
- Make sure that all included FU logo files are TeX-accessible.
  [After SVN checkout, find them in: \texmf\tex\latex\fuberlin]


- To us the FU beamer style, just do:
   \documentclass{beamer} or \documentclass[handout]{beamer}
   \usetheme{FUBerlin}


- ... and, if you want a title graphic:
   \titlegraphic{\includegraphics[height=3cm]{fu_dgm}}
  where fu_dgm is the included (and ugly) default eps file.


***************
*** OPTIONS ***
***************

Using [handout] option makes *everything* black-and-white, including rules and list arrows etc. It also changes the beavior of \alert to just \textbf.

*** USER-COMMANDS/OPTIONS ***
*****************************


1. Things to set with \renewcommand


\fuberlinfootstring
Reset this to change the contents of the left-hand part of the footer. See below for predefined versions.


\fuberlinpagestring
Reset this to change the contents of the right-hand part of the footer (default: SLIDENUMBER/SLIDECOUNT). See below for predefined versions.



2. Variables


\fuberlintitlestrut=... [DEFAULT: 0, RANGE: -n/+n pt]
Manipulate the horizontal position of the title graphics.



3. Simple commands to change the appearance of slides

[These are like mode commands. They set an option until it is explicitly set otherwise, e.g. back to the "normal" variant.]


\fuberlinnormalfootline [DEFAULT]
Switches on the default footer.


\fuberlinvoidfootline
NO footer at all, not even a \rule.


\fuberlinjustbarfootline [DEPRECATED!]
Same as \fuberlinvoidfootline.


\fuberlinemptyfootline
Just a \rule, no footer text.


\fuberlinlogon{ARG1} [DEFAULT], ARG
Switches the header logo on. It hast to be specified with a height for the logo graphics.
ARG1 can be used to resize the logo and thus give extra space for overfull slides. However, if this is what you want, you have to specify it *before* you say \begin{document} to allow beamer to calculate the header size based on newly provided measure.

Ex: To gain .1cm by making the header less high, do:

   \fuberlinlogon{.9cm}
   \begin{document}


\fuberlinlogoff
Switches the header logo off.


\fuberlinnormalheader [DEFAULT]
Switches on the default header with logo and navigation tree.


\fuberlinemptyheader
Switches off the header completely (not even a \rule).


\fuberlintitlepage
Inserts a fully fledged title page.


\fuberlinpagedec
Decrease the page counter by 1.
