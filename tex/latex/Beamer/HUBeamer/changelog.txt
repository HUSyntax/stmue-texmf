- changed the behavior of \fuberlinlogon so it
  can be used to resize the logo in order to
  gain some space for overfull slides.
  SEE fu-beamer-doc.txt BEFORE USING IT !!!

  *** COMPATIBILTY WITH OLDER DOCUMENTS
  *** IS BROKEN IF THESE USE \fuberlinlogon
  *** WITHOUT THE NOW OBLIGATORY ARGUMENT

- now using graphicx-psmin to avoid logo being
  inserted on every page in the ps
  => DON'T INCLUDE graphicx/graphics MANUALLY!
  => NOT TESTED WITH graphics INSTEAD OF graphicx .

- content of repository "latex" and "texmf"
  moved to one repo "texstuff"; only check out
  "texstuff" from now on

-------------------------------------------

2008-10-07

- Now uses \savebox to insert the logo. Definition
  of a logo with \logo is no longer allowed, the FU
  standard logo is used automatically, a 'fu_dgm_logo'
  (eps, png, etc.) must be findable by TeX.

- Removed "fuberlinbeamerincludes.tex".
  Don't include it anymore, it's part of the theme now!
- Killed some space above the frame title
  to make more room per frame
- Page numbers possibly not working due to ongoing work.
